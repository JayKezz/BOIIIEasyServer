‚ú® BOIIIEasyServer is a script written in batch that automates the installation of a T7 server (BOIII) with a simple click

### What does it do?
- It basically automates the installation process of a T7 server (BOIII) for Windows, automatically downloads everything necessary to start a server even if it still requires a little hand on the part of the user such as editing parts of your server such as (name, maximum clients, map rotation ...), automatically downloads steamcmd, installs the server files for Black Ops 3 and downloads the configuration files for the server <br> 
It requires a stable connection to download everything you need since they are ~3.6gb, the speed will depend on your internet connection.
Thanks to [Dss0](https://github.com/Dss0/) for the [configuration files](https://github.com/Dss0/t7-server-config)
